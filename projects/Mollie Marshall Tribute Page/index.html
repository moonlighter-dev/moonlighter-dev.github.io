    <h3 id="headline">The Story of Mollie's Birth</h3>
    <p>Mollie enjoyed relaying her family's story of her birth. She was told that her mother and her aunt were sitting outside on a hot summer day drinking mint julep tea. They heard a series of strange noises coming from the heavens, and eventually they could make out a giant bird descending through the treetops toward them. The bird had a small package tied to its beak, and when they came closer, they saw that it was a precious little baby. They took the baby and began to argue about what to name it. Her mother wanted to name her "Mollie," while her aunt wanted to name her "Nell," so they settled on calling her Mollie Nell Mims.

        The heart asks pleasure first,<br>
And then, excuse from pain;<br>
And then, those little anodynes<br>
That deaden suffering;<br>
And then, to go to sleep;<br>
And then, if it should be<br>
The will of its Inquisitor,<br>

This is my personal portfolio, outfitted per the requirements of FreeCodeCamp's Portfolio Project. I used it to finish my Responsive Web Design certification.

It also hosts my projects, including:

a Survey Form
a Tribute Page
a Technical Documentation Page
a Product Landing Page

I also link external projects here as well, such as sites that I have built for other people and/or businesses.

Thanks for stopping by!

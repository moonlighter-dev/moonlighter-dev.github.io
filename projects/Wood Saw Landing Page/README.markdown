# Wood Saw Landing Page

This was adapted from another landing page project.

The intention of this page is to:

provide a hub for people interested in our saw shop that features relevant information and accessibility to the online services we already use, namely our Stihl Powerchord website.

We also have a Facebook Page, so it will point to that as well.

Our owners and associates will be introduced so people can always come in and see a familiar face.

We are planning to feature a video series of "Tech Tips with Brian," so the landing page would be a great place for an introduction to the series.
